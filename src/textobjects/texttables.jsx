  aboutMe: `
  I am a divine seed — a carrier of sacred frequency, a part of the Whole. I incarnated in a physical body to experience life, to remember who I truly am, and to taste the wisdom of connection. My body, my emotions, thoughts, and intuition are the pathways through which I perceive, feel, and awaken — within this collective field we call Earth.
  
  My name is Gionianta (Ioanna) Kylafi, and my path in the field of complementary and energy healing began through my own search for deeper healing, inner truth, and soulful connection. This inner calling led me to study various holistic methods that support emotional, energetic, and spiritual well-being.
  
  My training includes:
    • Quantum Biofeedback Specialist – Biofeedback 2014 SRL, Quantum Medical SRL
    • Theta Healing – Theta Healing Institute of Knowledge
    • Regression Therapy – Earth Association Dip RTh
    • Hypnotherapy – CT HYP
    • Mindfulness – IACTM
    • Rejuvance Face Therapy Massage – MASTER I.S.A.E.K
  
  My work is the fruit of an ongoing inner journey — to touch my authentic essence and offer tools that help others remember theirs. In each session, in each meeting, my intention is to create a sacred space where truth, healing, and awakening can unfold with gentleness and safety.
  
  The greatest gift of this path?
  To recognize the truth of who you are.`,

We perceive it through our sensory systems (sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch, proprioception), as well as through our intuitive abilities, such as empathy, intuition, perception and awareness. When we function as observers of our energy, and of the energy around us, we expand our consciousness. We allow ourselves to feel the energy, to respect it, to move it. Vitality and what we call "life" is an expression of energy. And we are all part of this unity.'

When we recognize a dysfunction, a symptom or a disorder in the body or soul, then the field of therapy offers us everything that is necessary for healing to begin.
